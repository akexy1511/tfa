To ensure that your PHP application can be launched in a browser, you need to set up a local server environment. Here are the steps to do that:

1. **Install a Local Server**: Use software like XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP to create a local server environment. These packages include Apache, MySQL, and PHP.

2. **Place Your Project in the Server Directory**: After installing XAMPP or WAMP, place your project folder (the one containing your PHP files) in the `htdocs` directory (for XAMPP) or `www` directory (for WAMP).

3. **Start the Server**: Open the control panel for your server software and start the Apache and MySQL services.

4. **Access Your Project in a Browser**: Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/your_project_folder/`. Replace `your_project_folder` with the name of the folder where your PHP files are located.

5. **Database Setup**: If your project requires a database, import the `database.sql` file into your MySQL database using phpMyAdmin, which is usually accessible at `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`.

6. **Test Your Application**: Navigate through your application in the browser to ensure everything is working as expected.

By following these steps, you should be able to launch your PHP application in a browser successfully. If you need further assistance with specific files or configurations, feel free to ask!
