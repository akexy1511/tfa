To ensure that your PHP project can be launched in a browser, you need to set up a local server environment. Here are the steps to do that:

1. **Install a Local Server**: Use software like XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP to create a local server environment. These packages include Apache, MySQL, and PHP.

2. **Place Your Project in the Server Directory**: After installing XAMPP (for example), place your project folder (the one containing your PHP files) in the `htdocs` directory (usually located at `C:\xampp\htdocs`).

3. **Start the Server**: Open the XAMPP Control Panel and start the Apache server.

4. **Access Your Project in a Browser**: Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/your_project_folder/`. Replace `your_project_folder` with the name of the folder where your PHP files are located.

5. **Database Setup**: If your project requires a database, import the `database.sql` file into your MySQL database using phpMyAdmin (accessible at `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`).

6. **Check for Errors**: If you encounter any issues, check the Apache error logs for more information.

By following these steps, you should be able to run your PHP project in a web browser successfully. If you need specific modifications or additional files, please let me know!
