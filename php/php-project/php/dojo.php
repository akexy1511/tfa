To ensure that your PHP application can be launched in a browser, you need to set up a local server environment. Here are the steps to follow:

1. **Install a Local Server**: Use software like XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP to create a local server environment. These packages include Apache, MySQL, and PHP.

2. **Place Your Project in the Server Directory**: 
   - For XAMPP, place your project folder in `C:\xampp\htdocs\`.
   - For WAMP, place it in `C:\wamp\www\`.
   - For MAMP, place it in `Applications/MAMP/htdocs/`.

3. **Start the Server**: Open the control panel of your server software and start the Apache and MySQL services.

4. **Access Your Project in a Browser**: Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/your_project_folder/`. Replace `your_project_folder` with the name of the folder where your PHP files are located.

5. **Database Setup**: 
   - Import the `database.sql` file into your MySQL database using phpMyAdmin. Create a new database (e.g., `tfa_2025`) and import the SQL dump to set up the necessary tables and data.

6. **Test Your Application**: Open the main entry point of your application (e.g., `index.php`) in the browser to see if everything is working correctly.

Make sure that your PHP files are correctly configured to connect to the database using the credentials provided in `php.db`.
