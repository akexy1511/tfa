To ensure that your PHP application can be launched in a browser, you need to set up a local server environment. Here are the steps to do that:

1. **Install a Local Server**: You can use software like XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP to create a local server environment. These packages include Apache, MySQL, and PHP.

2. **Place Your Project in the Server Directory**: After installing XAMPP (for example), place your project folder (the one containing your PHP files) in the `htdocs` directory of your XAMPP installation (usually found at `C:\xampp\htdocs`).

3. **Start the Server**: Open the XAMPP Control Panel and start the Apache server. If you're using MySQL, you can start that as well.

4. **Access Your Project in a Browser**: Open a web browser and type in the URL to access your project. If your project folder is named `tfa`, you would access it via `http://localhost/tfa/php/php/`.

5. **Database Setup**: Make sure to import your `database.sql` file into your MySQL database using phpMyAdmin (accessible at `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`). Create a new database named `tfa_2025` and import the SQL dump.

6. **Check Your PHP Files**: Ensure that your PHP files are correctly set up to connect to the database using the credentials provided in `php.db`.

Once you have followed these steps, you should be able to launch your PHP application in a browser. If you encounter any issues, check the Apache error logs for more information.
